# Performance tuning {{{
# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to
# actually achieve 100FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a
# monitor with a high refresh rate.
repaint_delay    10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal
# is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but also
# increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that
# redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial
# screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents
# tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling. However,
# it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor. With a
# very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency.
# If so, set this to no.

# The shell program to execute. The default value of . means

# Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the default),
# the terminal will remain open when the child exits as long as there are still
# processes outputting to the terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded
# processes). If yes, the window will close as soon as the child process exits.
# Note that setting it to yes means that any background processes still using
# the terminal can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer
# work.
